Eyes Disease Image Classification I worked on a project to classify eye diseases images like diabetic retinopathy ,cataract ,glaucoma and normal using deep learning. 
I trained a convolutional neural network on eyes images from public datasets,
using techniques like image enhancement and transfer learning to improve accuracy.
